# Disclaimer
This is primarily a private fork for *purely* educational purposes, but I've made it public so other people might be able to learn from it as well if they're at all interested. Bradson writes incredible stuff and I want to learn from it, I'm using this as an opportunity to add C#/.NET to my tech stack, learn new OOP techniques(Types + Reflections, Transpiler, Harmony, etc) not covered in my SDev classes. Genuinely fascinating to me how Rimworld under the hood works and how PF is able to build on top of that using surgically precise replacements. 

Use at your own risk. If you want a stable version of Performance Fish, please be patient and use the original mod by bbradson when it comes out. Prepatcher is unofficially fixed so chances are he's actively working on a much better version of it right now. 

AI USE WAS STRICTLY ANALYTICAL TO LEARN C# SYNTAX!!! NO AI WAS USED TO WRITE OR MODIFY ANY OF THE CODE!!! ON GOD AI SUCKS!!! 

# Performance Fish
![](About/Preview.png?raw=true)  
  
Performance Mod for Rimworld.  
Requires [Prepatcher](https://github.com/Zetrith/Prepatcher) and [Fishery](https://github.com/bbradson/Fishery).  
  
Performance Fish attempts to improve overall framerates and tick times by patching various methods for improved efficiency, while keeping functionality identical. Designed to be used alongside other performance mods, like RocketMan, and intended to be compatible with very large modlists. Most patches become more impactful as the game progresses further into the lategame.  
  
A settings menu includes short descriptions for every patch, and each of them can be freely toggled in there. They get entirely unpatched in a disabled state, immediately. Nothing is stored in savefiles of specific game-sessions, ensuring that no errors get thrown when removing this mod.  
Special patches exist to add new entries and features to Dub's Performance Analyzer, including a right-click function allowing to profile overrides of functions.  
  
Almost all mods, including Combat Extended, Multiplayer, Vanilla Expanded, RocketMan and Performance Optimizer, are compatible.  
  
RimThreaded, RimWorld Rick, Oskar Obnoxious, No Laggy Beds and Better GC are currently marked as incompatible.
